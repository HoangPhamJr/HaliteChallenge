### Authors

Halite was primarily created by [Ben Spector](https://github.com/Sydriax) and [Michael Truell](https://github.com/truell20) for Two Sigma during their summer 2016 internship. However, many others contributed to Halite's developement, including [Matt Adereth](https://github.com/adereth), [Trammell Hudson](https://github.com/osresearch), and Jaques Clapauch from Two Sigma and [Arnaud Sahuguet](https://github.com/sahuguet) and [Scot Spinner](https://github.com/awesomescot) from Cornell Tech. Halite's participants have also been instrumental to the project, with [Nick Malaguti](https://github.com/nmalaguti) and [Travis Erdman](https://github.com/erdman) having contributed the most of all of the community.
